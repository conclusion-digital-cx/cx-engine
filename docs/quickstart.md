# Quick start
In this quick start guide we'll create our first CxEngine REST API server and a simple website to use it from scratch. It will show how easy it is to get started with CxEngine even without a generator or boilerplate.
 
Let's create a new folder for our application:
```sh
mkdir cxengine-app
cd cxengine-app
```

## Install from boilerplate
1. `git clone https://github.com/jellehak/cx-engine.git`
1. Rename `config.examples.php` to `config.php`.
2. Edit the settings to suit your needs.
3. Copy the files to your server.
4. Enter the url of your server in a webbrowser and you are good to go.

## Create your first page
