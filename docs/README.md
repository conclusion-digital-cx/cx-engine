# Development
Run `npm start` to spin up a PHP development server. 
This will start a new development server at http://localhost:8666/. ( This readme will use this host in examples. )

# Headless API
The headless API is a light Restfull API that supports all SQL databases (including MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Oracle and more). Get quickly started with sqlite and later in production switch to more performant databases if needed.
